# Dockerizing Spring Boot Application

Welcome to the Dockerization guide for a Spring Boot application! This repository provides step-by-step instructions on how to containerize your Spring Boot project using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to dockerize your Spring Boot application:

### 1. Create a Dockerfile

Create a Dockerfile at the root of your project. This file contains instructions for building a Docker image.

```Dockerfile
# Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a base image
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application JAR file into the container
COPY target/your-spring-app.jar /app

# Specify the command to run on container startup
CMD ["java", "-jar", "your-spring-app.jar"]
```

Replace `your-spring-app.jar` with the actual name of your Spring Boot application JAR file.

### 2. Build the Docker Image

Open a terminal and navigate to the project root directory. Run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t your-spring-app .
```

### 3. Run the Docker Container

After successfully building the Docker image, run the following command to start a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 your-spring-app
```

Replace `8080` with the desired host port for your application.

### 4. Access Your Application

Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to access your Spring Boot application running inside a Docker container.

## Additional Considerations

- Customize environment variables, security configurations, and other settings in your Dockerfile for production deployment.
- Explore Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications.
